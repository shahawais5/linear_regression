 code defines a LinearRegression class that takes input data (x and y arrays)
 and provides methods for training the model (train) and making predictions (predict).
 The train method calculates the slope and intercept
 of the best-fit line using the ordinary least squares method.
 The predict method uses the calculated slope and intercept to make predictions for new input values.
In the main function, we create an instance of LinearRegression,
provide input data, and train the model.
 Then, we make a prediction for an input value of 6 and print the calculated slope,
  intercept, and the prediction itself.
  the LinearRegression class remains the same as before.
  However, the main() function is replaced by a Flutter app.
  We create a LinearRegressionApp widget that extends StatefulWidget.
  Inside the LinearRegressionAppState,
  we initialize the linear regression model,
  train it, and make a prediction in the initState() method.

  The UI is created using a Scaffold with an AppBar
  and a Center widget that contains the Column widget to display the slope,
   intercept, and prediction results. The slope and intercept are displayed using Text widgets,
    and the prediction is also displayed using a Text widget.
